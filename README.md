** This md file will be updated occasionally **

** This is a side project WebApp utilizing react.js + vite. **

** React.js (ver. >= 18) and vite. This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. **

TODO:

- integrate backend task-app api
- deploy to web hosting, will look into netlify
- implement tasks based on user
- forms validations
- other features like update tasks, drag and drop task cards according to columns (To do, In progress, Delete) and so much more..

Dev notes:

- functionality: Create, Read, Delete
- used tags and some basic css
- prop level up to 2nd child only (this is allowable according to best practices)
- used useState for state management and useEffect for future API calls and interaction outside of react components
- used localstorage for temporary database purposes
